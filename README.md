# Bayesian-Enhanced EEG Signal Analysis for Epileptic Seizure Recognition: A 1D-CNN LSTM Approach

The intricate neurological condition known as epilepsy, which is common across the world, presents considerable difficulties in accurately identifying and differentiating between non-epileptic and epileptic activity using electroencephalograms (EEGs). To customize successful therapies, it is essential to accurately identify the kinds of epileptic activity. Since epilepsy affects about 50 million people worldwide according to latest update of WHO and is typified by spontaneous seizures, early identification and prediction are vital in enabling people to minimize possible harm. The current seizure prediction methods lack with particular emphasis on their limited performance on small training datasets and their disregard for time-series data. To identify small patterns in EEG data, this study combines cutting edge technologies, like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and 1D-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) leveraging data from five hundred patients acquired from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. To optimize the 1D-CNN LSTM architecture and hyper-parameters, Bayesian optimization is employed, allowing for efficient exploration of the parameter space. Its effectiveness is not only limited to enhancing the performance metrics of a particular model but also minimizing the computing power required for fine tuning. The research evaluates the effectiveness of the 1D-CNN LSTM-based model, showcasing its potential as a reliable tool for automated epilepsy detection with accuracy of 99.47% (â‰ˆ 100%), average sensitivity of 99.45%, and average specificity of 99.57%. This approach, emphasizes the significance of anticipating seizures in advance, attempts to provide epileptics the tools they need to control and avoid seizures in advance, so ultimately enhancing their quality of life for patients.
